The data set I have selected for analysis consists of over 100,000 medical appointments in Brazil. The goal of this project is
to determine which independent variables may influence the dependent variable. The dependent variable in this dataset
is whether a patient shows or does not show for their medical appointment. This project involved using a series of functions and methods
via the Pandas and Numpy Python libraries. Data exploration and data visualization to report on any associations between any of the independent 
variables and the dependent variable were done using Matplotlib.
